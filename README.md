## Features:
1. 3D Physics Simulation using Cannon.js. Players can experience the gravity, speed, acceleration and inertia from the simulation by rolling the ball around passing through high grounds and low grounds.

2. Interaction with surrounding objects. Players can push crates around to help to overcome certain obstacles or just to have fun smashing crates.

6. Multiplayer using Colyseus.js. You can race with your friends for even more fun experience. (However, do note that in multiplayers mode, the physics simulation is done on the server side, so there will be some latency for all the movements and animations.)

7. Highscore board. You can get your name on the hall of fame if you manage to reach the goal.
